## Contributing
If you want to add something to this project, feel free to fork the UnRen repo and
open a pull request with your addition.

Though not interested in complicating things, we want to set some basic standards:
- Don't make commits and/or pull request to big; separate thematic if possible
- Pure cosmetic changes like corrected typos or formating will not be accepted.
Add these to a valid content addition commit.
- Fill always a self explaining commit message
- If you're unsure if your contribution will be accepted ask beforehand. It's cost free.
