# Info
This directory contains the RenPy config snippeds which are used by UnRen. Theyre
intended for embedding in the python main files, but can also be downloaded and
used in a RenPy game as they are.

**The currently available files are:**
- dev_con.rpy -> Console and developer menu
- quick.rpy -> Quick save and load
- rollback.rpy ->  Goes back to previous screen/game state
- skip.rpy ->  Skip game text

_Note:_ The comment lines format is for a reason like this. Do not change. UnRen
uses them as ID.
